# Music Streaming Platform Database Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Music Streaming Platform Database Project! This project is focused on designing and implementing a database for a music streaming platform. Below you will find detailed information about the project, including its objectives, the files included, and instructions for setting up and running the database.


## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive database for a music streaming platform. The database is designed to handle various aspects of a music streaming service, including user information, music tracks, playlists, and streaming history. The project involves creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), writing SQL queries, and documenting the learning process.

## Files Included

1. **SQLQueriesSpecificationDocument.pdf**: This document provides a brief description of each SQL query used in the project. It serves as a guide to understanding the purpose and functionality of each query.
2. **FINAL_ERD.pdf**: This file contains the final Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the database. It visually represents the database structure, including tables, relationships, and key constraints.
3. **TeamsLearningReport.pdf**: This document summarizes the team's learning experiences throughout the project. It highlights the challenges faced, solutions found, and the knowledge gained during the development process.
4. **DatabaseProject.sql**: This file contains all the SQL queries for the project. The queries can be opened with any text editor and should be copied and pasted into PostgreSQL for execution.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the database, follow these steps:

1. **Open the SQL File**: Open the `DatabaseProject.sql` file using any text editor of your choice.
2. **Copy the Queries**: Select all the code in the file by pressing `Ctrl+A`, then copy the selected code by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
3. **Paste the Queries into PostgreSQL**: Open your PostgreSQL client, create a new query window, and paste the copied code by pressing `Ctrl+V`.
4. **Run the Queries**: Execute the queries chunk by chunk in PostgreSQL to create and populate the database.
